Novel MRI Pulse Sequence to Image Upper Airway Anatomy and Measure Changes in Neurometabolism During Volitional Model Apneas
======

Motivation:
--------------------------------------------------------------
While the neurometabolic consequences of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are thought to play a role in downstream risk for various disorders, quantifying these changes during natural sleep remains a scientific challenge.

Goal(s):
---------------------------------------------------------------------
We aim to validate a custom MRI sequence for detecting neurometabolism and upper airway architecture during volitional apneas.

Approach:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
During scanning, awake healthy volunteers were asked to perform breath holds and swallowing apneas.

Results:
--------------------------------------------
Both breath-hold and swallowing model apneas increased CBF and SVO2 resulting in increased CMRO2, but only swallowing apneas were associated with an effective closure of the upper airway.

Impact:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifying specific changes in neurometabolism and upper-airway architecture with an experimental paradigm validates the proposed approach before applications in a more challenging naturalistic observation. Experiments in healthy subjects also helps contextualize the magnitude of changes noted in natural observations.
