Yovanno, R., Buckner, A., Kamath, R., Dennison, J.B.(2022). In this workshop we showed how we compared activation from a two trained neural nets to fmri activation in the brain. We compare how well each layer of the convolutional neural net compares to activation from different levels of the what and where pathways of the brain.
