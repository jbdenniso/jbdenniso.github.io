I am a fifth year PhD student at Temple University studying the neurocomputational processes of judgment and decision-making using computational modeling and fMRI. I graduated with my B.A. from Hawai'i Pacific University where I was introduced to behavioral science and statistics. I then got some of my first tastes of neuroecomics as a M.A. student at New York University working with Paul Glimcher comparing computational markers of risk aversion and temporal discounting to typical questionaires meant to gauge similar constructs of risk-taking and impulse control. I then got a real introduction with neuroimaging methods as a research assistant and lab manager at Rutgers University working with Mauricio Delgado.

Now as a PhD student I'm developing my own lines of research centered around reward processing, functional connectivity using MRI, and clinical disorders. 
 
Research interests
======
The big questions surrounding my research interests is trying to understand how humans make sense of the world through a lense of judgment and decision-making.


Computational Models of Decision Making
-------------------------
Recent developements have allowed for the computational modeling of human decisions. A large part of my research interests revolve around testing these models to better understand what internal processes might be at work as we evaluate different options. In particular, I am interested in how people make decisions under unkown risks (or ambiguity) and how our perceptions about what the likely risks are influences our decisions.

Functional Connectivity and Rewards
-----------------------------------
The striatum and prefrontal cortex have been strongly chacterized as regions which encode the subjective value of rewards. However, these regions do not work isolated from each other but rather in tandem. There are a strong set of white matter tracts which organize the structural connections between the striatum and prefrontal cortex and the coactivation of these regions in response to rewards suggests that they share information during the valuation and processing of rewards. What kind of information is shared? Why do we need two regions to process different rewards?

Neuro-imaging and Statistical Methods
---------------------
Much of my work involves the neural processing of rewards and how that processing affects the kinds of decisions we make. Neuroimaging through (functional)MRI has been a strong tool to help understand those neural processes. However, the techniques for acquiring and analyzing MRI data are constantly evolving. My research both utilizes contemporary techniques, like using tensorial ICA to characterize individual differences, and studies them, like analyzing difference in statistical power when using multi-echo aquisition.

Other interest
======
Asides from my direct research interests I spend a lot of time working in the community on adjacent problems revolving around how we do science.

Free and Open Source Science, Data, and Software
----------------------------------------
I am an open advocate of "open" science. Sometimes this means publishing in open access publications or making the data, analyses, and scripts from my projects available on central repositories. Othertimes I get to actually contribute, if just a little bit, to open projects like tedana and nilearn. Most often I am just a user and and advocate of open source software among friends and collegues.


Personal interests
-----
In my personal time, I like to play music, board games with my friends, and spend time with my family. I was classically taught both piano and guitar. I continue to play both in my free time. Some of the most fun I have had is taking a whole night playing a table-top RPG with my friends. I like to play games like DND, Pandemic, and One Night Werewolf.
