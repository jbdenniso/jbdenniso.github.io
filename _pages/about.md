Models of Decision Making
-------------------------
Recent developements have allowed for the computational modeling of human decisions. A large part of my research interests revolve around testing these models to better understand what internal processes might be at work as we evaluate different options. In particular, I am interested in how people make decisions under unkown risks (or ambiguity) and how our perceptions about what the likely risks are influences our decisions. Question? Question? Question?

Functional Connectivity and Rewards
-----------------------------------
The striatum and prefrontal cortex have been strongly chacterized as regions which encode the subjective value of rewards. However, these regions do not work isolated from each other but rather in tandem. There are a strong set of white matter tracts which organize the structural connections between the striatum and prefrontal cortex and the coactivation of these regions in response to rewards suggests that they share information during the valuation and processing of rewards. What kind of information is shared? Why do we need two regions to process different rewards?

Neuro-imaging Methods
---------------------
Much of my work involves the neural processing of rewards and how that processing affects the kinds of decisions we make. Neuroimaging through (functional)MRI has been a strong tool to help understand those neural processes. However, the techniques for acquiring and analyzing MRI data are evolving as well. My research both utilizes contemporary techniques, like using tensorial ICA to characterize individual differences, and studies them, like analyzing difference in statistical power when using multi-echo aquisition.

Asides from my research I have

Music
-----
I was classically taught both piano and guitar. I continue to play both in my free time.

Board Games
-----------
Some of the most fun I have had is taking a whole night playing a table-top RPG with my friends. I like to play games like DND, Pandemic, and One Night Werewolf.
