2020-05-20	Variability in the analysis of a single neuroimaging dataset by many teams	Nature	Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2,3,4,5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.	Botvinik-Nezer, R., Holzmeister, F., Camerer, C.

2020-10-29	The Role of Social Reward and Corticostriatal Connectivity in Substance Use - PMC	J. Psychiatric Brain Sci.	This report describes an ongoing R03 grant that explores the links between trait reward sensitivity, substance use, and neural responses to social and nonsocial reward. Although previous research has shown that trait reward sensitivity and neural responses to reward are linked to substance use, whether this relationship is impacted by how people process social stimuli remains unclear. We are investigating these questions via a neuroimaging study with college-aged participants, using individual difference measures that examine the relation between substance use, social context, and trait reward sensitivity with tasks that measure reward anticipation, strategic behavior, social reward consumption, and the influence of social context on reward processing. We predict that substance use will be tied to distinct patterns of striatal dysfunction. Specifically, reward hyposensitive individuals will exhibit blunted striatal responses to social and non-social reward and enhanced connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex; in contrast, reward hypersensitive individuals will exhibit enhanced striatal responses to social and non-social reward and blunted connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex. We also will examine the relation between self-reported reward sensitivity, substance use, and striatal responses to social reward and social context. We predict that individuals reporting the highest levels of substance use will show exaggerated striatal responses to social reward and social context, independent of self-reported reward sensitivity. Examining corticostriatal responses to reward processing will help characterize the relation between reward sensitivity, social context and substance use while providing a foundation for understanding risk factors and isolating neurocognitive mechanisms that may be targeted to increase the efficacy of interventions.

2021-05-01	Inflammatory Signaling and Corticostriatal Functional Connectivity to Anticipated Valence and Salience of Reward and Threat Stimuli: An Investigation in Depressed vs. Non-Depressed Young Adults	Biological Psychiatry	Growing research suggests that low-grade inflammatory signaling is associated with neural abnormalities in processing reward and threat cues, with the relationship differing for depressed individuals. No studies have addressed whether the valence or salience of these cues characterizes the abnormalities. Thus, this study examined whether inflammation is associated with distinct neural patterns as a function of anticipated cue valence and salience among individuals with and without depression.

2022-02-08	Decision neuroscience and neuroeconomics: Recent progress and ongoing challenges	WIREs Cognitive Science	In the past decade, decision neuroscience and neuroeconomics have developed many new insights in the study of decision making. This review provides an overarching update on how the field has advanced in this time period. Although our initial review a decade ago outlined several theoretical, conceptual, methodological, empirical, and practical challenges, there has only been limited progress in resolving these challenges. We summarize significant trends in decision neuroscience through the lens of the challenges outlined for the field and review examples where the field has had significant, direct, and applicable impacts across economics and psychology. First, we review progress on topics including reward learning, exploreâ€“exploit decisions, risk and ambiguity, intertemporal choice, and valuation. Next, we assess the impacts of emotion, social rewards, and social context on decision making. Then, we follow up with how individual differences impact choices and new exciting developments in the prediction and neuroforecasting of future decisions. Finally, we consider how trends in decision-neuroscience research reflect progress toward resolving past challenges, discuss new and exciting applications of recent research, and identify new challenges for the field.

2023-01-19	Substance use is related to differential activation and connectivity for social relative to monetary rewards | bioRxiv	BioRxiv	Substance use (SU) has been linked to alterations in reward processing in the ventral striatum (VS). However, less is known about how SU relates to striatal activation and connectivity during social rewards (e.g., positive peer feedback). In this pre-registered study, we hypothesized that SU would be associated with activation and functional connectivity of the VS during receipt of social rewards. Participants (N=44) underwent two fMRI tasks to isolate neural response to social and monetary rewards. The tasks involved choosing between two stimuli: either two purported peers, with the goal of identifying the peer who liked the participant (social); or two doors, with the goal of identifying the door containing a $0.50 prize (monetary). We predicted that VS activation in response to social rewards would be correlated with SU, independent of reward sensitivity (RS); however, an exploratory whole-brain analysis revealed SU was related to activation in the temporoparietal junction instead. Moreover, results showed that aberrant RS blunts the relationship between SU and striatal activation during receipt of rewards, regardless of their domain. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis demonstrated that SU was associated with decreased connectivity between the VS and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex for social rewards, independent of RS. Exploratory analyses further revealed that RS is associated with increased connectivity between the VS and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during social rewards. Taken together, these findings shed light on the relationships between potential risk factors for developing substance use disorder.	Wyngaarden III, J. B., Johnston, C. R., Sazhin, D., Dennison, J.

2023-02-07	Tensorial Independent Component Analysis Reveals Social and Reward Networks Associated with Major Depressive Disorder	BioRxiv	Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with changes in functional brain connectivity. Yet, typical analyses of functional connectivity, such as spatial ICA for resting-state data, often ignore sources of between-subject variability, which may be crucial for identifying functional connectivity patterns associated with MDD. Typically, methods like spatial ICA will identify a single component to represent a network like the default mode network (DMN), even if groups within the data show differential DMN coactivation. To address this gap, this project applies a tensorial extension of ICA (tensorial ICA) -- which explicitly incorporates between-subject variability -- to identify functionally connected networks using fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Data from the HCP included individuals with a diagnosis of MDD, a family history of MDD, and healthy controls performing a gambling and social cognition task. Based on evidence associating MDD with blunted neural activation to rewards and social stimuli, we predicted that tensorial ICA would identify networks associated with reduced spatio-temporal coherence and blunted social and reward-based network activity in MDD. Across both tasks, tensorial ICA identified three networks showing decreased coherence in MDD. All three networks included ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and cerebellum and showed different activation across the conditions of their respective tasks. However, MDD was only associated with differences in task-based activation in one network from the social task. Additionally, these results suggest that tensorial ICA could be a valuable tool for understanding clinical differences in relation to network activation and connectivity.	Dennison, J. B., Tepfer, L.
