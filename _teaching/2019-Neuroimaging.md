Course Overview
======
This course is intended to provide a comprehensive and rigorous introduction to the technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a powerful tool for measuring brain function. Students will learn the basic physics underlying MRI, the biological principles of fMRI, the principles of experimental design, the processing steps associated with data analysis, and the use of available software packages. Each week's session will be composed of a lecture and integrated laboratory session. The laboratory sessions will utilize Amazon Web Services and will involve analysis of fMRI data sets that illustrate issues discussed in the lectures. We will also have discussions focused on interpretative and ethical challenges with neuroimaging studies. Assessments in the class will include exams, participation, and a final project presentation. This course is designed to give students an understanding of the potential and limitations of this technique, and the ability to critically evaluate the inferences that can be drawn from fMRI.
