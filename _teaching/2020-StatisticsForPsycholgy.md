Course Description
======
The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to statistics in psychology. We will spend the semester learning the concepts and corresponding methods that will allow us to ask the question, "But how do you know that is true?" Statistics are essential in allowing us to assess whether or not an observed phenomenon might have occurred by chance alone. Additionally, we will read psychological journal articles that utilize the statistics we are learning so that we can see how psychologists use and write about statistics.
