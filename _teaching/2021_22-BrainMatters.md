Course Description
======
One of the last frontiers in science is the brain. We know a great deal about the structure and
function of the brain and nervous system, but it is challenging to comprehend fully the complexity of a system made up
of 100 billion components that are interacting with one another using tens of trillions of connections that can change
and rewire during development and aging. Neuroscience is the multidisciplinary field in which brain research falls.
Neuroscience is one of the fastest growing domains in all of science - and good bet for a future career path.
Neuroscientists investigate brain function from the level of molecular genetics, to cellular dynamics, to brain anatomy
and physiology, to relations between brain, behavior, and cognition, to brain development and aging, to diseases of the
brain. In this course, we will touch on knowledge about the brain at all these levels, and more. We will also discuss case
studies of brain impairment.
