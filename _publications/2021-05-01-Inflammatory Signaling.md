title: "Inflammatory Signaling and Corticostriatal Functional Connectivity to Anticipated Valence and Salience of Reward and Threat Stimuli: An Investigation in Depressed vs. Non-Depressed Young Adults"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-05-01-Inflammatory Signaling
excerpt: 'Growing research suggests that low-grade inflammatory signaling is associated with neural abnormalities in processing reward and threat cues, with the relationship differing for depressed individuals. No studies have addressed whether the valence or salience of these cues characterizes the abnormalities. Thus, this study examined whether inflammation is associated with distinct neural patterns as a function of anticipated cue valence and salience among individuals with and without depression.'
